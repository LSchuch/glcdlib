History
-------
* Original code by Brandon 'cstone' Creighton, in the public domain.
* This code derived from: https://github.com/adafruit/ST7565-LCD, LGPL (why?).
* SPI optimizations and other small tweaks by Jean-Claude Wippler, 2010.
* Several new functions and remote/proxying code by Steve Evans, 2010.
* Renamed to GLCDlib to avoid confusion with the ST7565 library for Arduino.
